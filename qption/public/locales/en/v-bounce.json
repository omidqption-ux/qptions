        "subtitle": "To maximize profits in smaller trades, many traders focus on more liquid markets to increase trade frequency. One popular 60-second options strategy involves identifying clear price rebounds from defined support or resistance levels. This approach allows traders to capitalize on rapid, predictable price movements in a short time frame."

        "p1": "Support and resistance (S&R) levels are essential tools for trading on Qption.

Recognizing these zones enables traders to make more informed decisions, anticipating price rebounds or breakouts to optimize their trading strategies.",
        "p2": "When price approaches pre-determined support or resistance, traders can define a potential “break or bounce spot.” This clarifies whether price is more likely to rebound off the level or break through it, signaling continuation.",
